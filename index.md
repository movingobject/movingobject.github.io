# What is Stereotic 

[Stereotic](https://stereotic.com) turns investment to a joyful experience by providing highly efficient tools for the complex task of managing our financial portfolio:

- to set our investment goals and risk tolerance,
- to conduct research, to investigate lots of ideas and stories,
- to chose a strategy and to pick assets to invest in,
- to adjust our portfolio - sell and buy,
- to monitor the results and intervene when necessary.

We start with crypto, and progress towards a fully fledged financial portfolio management service.

Stereotic is in preview mode: we have made the "Explore" application available for free, which provides highly efficient comparative analysis, integrated charts, statistics, signals, AI-selected news and social media data.
